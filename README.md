Human in the LOOP

Quick labelling with streamlit and QDrant. First I'll support NLP, then I'll think about adding image support (which is where this idea came from).

- [ ] Supports interactively creating and storing queries for the QDrant Vector Database for an NLP dataset.
- [ ] Maybe support Active Learning (eventually) 

See Kern.AI for a full blown solution using very similar technology behind the scenes. This tool is meant to be simple enough to act as an intro to vector databases.

Similarly, koaning/bulk is excellent, but what if UMAP (insert alternative dimensionality reduction technique here) loses all of the nuance, and high-level visualizations fail to provide value for your dataset?
